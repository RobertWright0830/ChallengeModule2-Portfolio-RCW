# ChallengeModule2-Portfolio-RCW

## Description

This website allows a developer to present potential employers sample work and contact information on how the developer can be reached.

This was accomplished by:

-providing the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

-included the functionality to click the links in the navigation to allow user to scroll to the corresponding section

-included titled images of the developer's applications

-the developer's first application is intended to be larger in size than the others

-clicked images deploy the application so the user can view (NOTE THAT THE DEVELOPER ONLY HAS ONE DEPLOYED APPLICATION SO ALL OTHERS HAVE DEAD LINKS.  DEVELOPER
INCLUDED FORMAT SO THAT THEY CAN BE EASILY UPDATED AS MORE APPLICATIONS ARE DEPLOYED)

-functionality exists that allows for a responsive layout that adapts to the users viewport due to resizing or device used
